This RPC shows a custom rich presense on your Discord profile, this can include up to 2 buttons with links and 2 titles, a tutorial is in a read.me file!


**Getting started**

First, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

After that, you can edit any data in `index.js`, i will show you more infos inside the file. After that, save your changes and run `node index.js`.
(You need to create an Application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to create a custom RPC. 

Here is an example how my status looks:
